p2pfs
=====

This is a prototype of a peer-to-peer distributed file system using Python Twisted, Entangled (Kademlia) and FUSE.

Directory structure:

cloud-scripts/ - scripts for starting/stopping cloud servers
helper-scripts/ - benchmarks, bootstrapping scripts, node running scripts
lxc-scripts/ - scripts for setting up LXC containers
src/ - p2pfs source code

Each directory contains its own README file that explains the contents.
